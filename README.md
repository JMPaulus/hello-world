The very CSS first steps
This is me, a guy that speaks some languages and who decided to study JavaScript.
First I need to learn HTML.
Then CSS.
Then JavaScript.
I am starting new course, a yearly frontend training. Fingers crossed, please.
I wish I could have a per cent of the genius that Margaret Hamilton had.
